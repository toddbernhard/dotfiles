Creating a nice command-line development environment takes a lot of configuration, but it can be worth it (see __Why__). These are the settings I like, and some instructions to quickly setup a working environment.

### terminal

the emulator depends on the setup, but a few customizations are common. It's worth spending some time figuring out what you like, because this is what you might look at all day.
- fonts: I like Droid Sans Mono, Consolas Bold (owned by MS), Inconsolata Bold
- colors: check out http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/

### ssh

allows you to work remotely -- from home, from the beach, from your Chromebook 3 feet away from your build server.

- Setup your client RSA keys
- Add common destinations to `~/.ssh/config`

### zsh

is like __bash__, but feels a bit smarter. Check out the [zsh directory](zsh/) for more.

### tmux
### vim
### git
### bash scripts
